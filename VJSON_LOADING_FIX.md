# VJSON File Loading Issue - Resolution

## Problem Description
The project was experiencing issues with loading the `ss-0121.vjson` file. The main problem was an incorrect file path in the `webgiInit.ts` file.

## Root Cause
In `src/webgiInit.ts`, the `sceneFile` variable was set to:
```typescript
const sceneFile = '/assets/ss-0121.vjson';
```

However, the actual `ss-0121.vjson` file was located in the root directory of the project, not in an `assets` folder.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed File Path
Changed the `sceneFile` path in `src/webgiInit.ts`:
```typescript
// Before
const sceneFile = '/assets/ss-0121.vjson';

// After
const sceneFile = '/ss-0121.vjson';
```

### 2. Moved File to Public Directory
Copied the `ss-0121.vjson` file to the `public/` directory so it can be served by the development server:
```bash
Copy-Item ss-0121.vjson public/
```

### 3. Enhanced Vite Configuration
Added the `vjsonPlugin` to the Vite configuration in `vite.config.js` to properly handle `.vjson` files:
```javascript
plugins: [
  react(),
  tailwindcss(),
  vjsonPlugin,  // Added this line
  rollupJson({
    include: '**/*.vjson',
    preferConst: true,
  })
],
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced the `webgiInit.ts` file with better error handling for file loading:
```typescript
try {
  console.log('Loading scene file:', sceneFile);
  const sceneLoad = await viewer.load(sceneFile);
  console.log('[sceneLoad]', sceneLoad);
  await sceneLoad;
  console.log('Scene loaded successfully!');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to load scene file:', error);
  throw new Error(`Failed to load scene file: ${sceneFile}. Please ensure the file exists in the public directory.`);
}
```

## File Structure After Fix
```
00_joaze-learning-guide/
├── public/
│   ├── ss-0121.vjson  ← File moved here
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   ├── webgiInit.ts   ← Path fixed here
│   └── ...
├── ss-0121.vjson      ← Original file (kept as backup)
└── ...
```

## Testing
A test file `test-vjson-loading.html` has been created to verify that the vjson file can be loaded correctly. You can access it at `http://localhost:5173/test-vjson-loading.html` when the development server is running.

## Verification Steps
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the application in a browser
3. Check the browser console for successful loading messages
4. The 3D viewer should now display the model from the vjson file

## Additional Notes
- The linter error about the 'webgi' module is expected since it's a custom package from a specific URL
- Dependencies were installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve version conflicts
- The file is now properly served from the public directory and accessible via HTTP requests
